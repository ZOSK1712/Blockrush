A little puzzle game made in Pico 8.

How to play :

You play as a cube in a 2D world. When you move, you cannot stop until you reach a solid object. To finish a level, get to the treasure chest ! There are also hidden crowns that you can (you don’t have to) pickup during your game.

This game is just a prototype submitted to the Pixeler’s game jam. It will be deleted when the game jam is finished, but the full version will soon be released.
